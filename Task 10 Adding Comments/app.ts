// 10.Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// this program is personal message and this line is in comments form, 
// so it doesn't apply on your code..

let person_name : string = "Siddiqui"
// now person_name is variable which stored a name "Eric"
let message : string = "would you like to learn some python today"
//  and message is a varibale which stored a message for a person. 
//  Now print them togather

console.log (`Hello, ${person_name} ! ${message}??`);
