// 6.Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
var person_name = "Fahad Siddiqui";
// print with white spaces
console.log("\t\n ".concat(person_name, " \t\n"));
//print without spaces
console.log(person_name);
